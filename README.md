# Deep Learning Basics: A Beginner's Journey

<h3>Welcome to <i>Deep Learning Basics - A Beginner's Journey.</i><br><br>
In order to renew my Deep Learning knowledge, but to simultaneously expand my skills even further on the process and also showcase what I know about this magnificent field, I decided to develop this short course about Deep Learning.<br><br>
I will try my best to cover some basic topics about Deep Learning and even dare to dive into some slightly more demanding ones as well.<br><br>

Best wishes to you all, as you proceed through each chapter.</h3>
